---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Create structure and dependencies for Play Integrity integration

### Setup Tasks

- [x] T151 Create IntegrityStatus SQLite table migration in mobile/src/storage/migrations/ (add columns: `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 'singleton'`, `integrity_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`, `verified_at TEXT NOT NULL`, `created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`)
- [x] T152 [P] Create mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts with stub functions for `checkIntegrity()`, `requestToken()`, `validateVerdict()`, `isCacheValid()`, `getCacheTTL()`
- [x] T153 [P] Create mobile/src/stores/play-integrity.store.ts with Zustand store for `integrityState`, `setIntegrityStatus()`, `clearIntegrityCache()` selectors

**Checkpoint**: Project structure in place for Phase 2 implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Database schema, API module, and shared utility setup

### Mobile Foundational Tasks

- [x] T154 [P] Implement IntegrityStatusRepository in mobile/src/storage/repositories/integrity.repository.ts with methods: `getStatus()`, `saveStatus()`, `clearStatus()`, `checkCacheTTL()`
- [x] T155 Update mobile/src/storage/database.ts to initialize IntegrityStatus table on app startup in `initializeDatabase()` function
- [x] T156 [P] Create mobile/src/components/IntegrityBlockedScreen.tsx (full-screen blocking UI, "Get from Play Store" button, no navigation access)
- [x] T157 [P] Implement `__DEV__` bypass check in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts with console log: `[PlayIntegrity] Bypassed in development mode`

### Backend Foundational Tasks

- [x] T158 Create api/src/integrity/dto/verify-token.dto.ts with `VerifyTokenRequest` interface: `{ token: string }`
- [x] T159 [P] Create api/src/integrity/dto/integrity-verdict.dto.ts with `PlayIntegrityVerdict` interface per data-model.md
- [x] T160 Create api/src/integrity/integrity.service.ts stub with method `verifyToken(token: string): Promise<PlayIntegrityVerdict>`
- [x] T161 [P] Create api/src/integrity/integrity.controller.ts stub with `POST /api/integrity/verify` endpoint
- [x] T162 Create api/src/integrity/integrity.module.ts and register IntegrityModule in api/src/app.module.ts
- [x] T163 Add environment variable support for Google Play Console credentials in api/src/config/ (no actual credentials in code)

**Checkpoint**: Infrastructure ready; user story implementation can proceed

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Legitimate Play Store User (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: User installs from Play Store, first launch verifies invisibly, subsequent launches cached—always offline-capable

**Independent Test**: Install from Play Store → app launches normally → airplane mode → relaunch → works offline

### Backend Tasks (US1)

- [x] T164 [P] [US1] Implement `verifyToken()` in api/src/integrity/integrity.service.ts: call Google Play Console API to decrypt token, extract verdict fields (`appRecognitionVerdict`, `appLicensingVerdict`, `deviceRecognitionVerdict`)
- [x] T165 [US1] Implement `POST /api/integrity/verify` endpoint in api/src/integrity/integrity.controller.ts: accept VerifyTokenRequest, return IntegrityVerdict (success: true) or error (success: false) with error message

### Mobile Tasks (US1)

- [x] T166 [US1] Implement `checkIntegrity()` in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: on first launch, request token from Google Play Integrity API, call POST /api/integrity/verify, validate verdict (all pass → store cache with verified_at timestamp)
- [x] T167 [P] [US1] Implement cache validation in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: check IntegrityStatus, if verified=true and verified_at < 30 days → skip verification, grant access. If verified_at >= 30 days (expired cache per FR-009) → re-verify using full checkIntegrity() flow from T166 (request new token, call API, validate verdict, update cache)
- [x] T168 [US1] Integrate integrity check into mobile/src/App.tsx: parallel Promise.all() with DB init and integrity check; if verification passes → render RootNavigator, else → hold init screen, app loads normally

**Checkpoint**: Play Store users can launch and verify; cached access works offline

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sideloaded APK Blocked (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Sideloaded or re-signed APKs blocked on launch with clear user message and Play Store link

**Independent Test**: Build release APK → `adb install` (sideload) → blocking screen appears → taps "Open Play Store" → opens Play Store (or shows message)

### Backend Tasks (US2)

- [x] T169 [US2] Add error handling to api/src/integrity/integrity.service.ts: if Google API returns UNLICENSED, UNRECOGNIZED_VERSION, or device integrity fail → return verdict as-is (client interprets as block)

### Mobile Tasks (US2)

- [x] T170 [US2] Implement definitive failure detection in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: if verdict contains UNLICENSED, UNRECOGNIZED_VERSION, or device fail → set error type: 'DEFINITIVE', return `{ verified: false, error: { type: 'DEFINITIVE', message: 'For security reasons, this app must be downloaded from Google Play.' } }`
- [x] T171 [US2] Update mobile/src/App.tsx to render IntegrityBlockedScreen when integrity check returns definitive failure (no RootNavigator access)
- [x] T172 [P] [US2] Implement "Open Play Store" button in mobile/src/components/IntegrityBlockedScreen.tsx: on press, navigate to Play Store (or show how-to message if unavailable) using `Linking.openURL()`
- [x] T173 [US2] Add error logging to mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: log definitive verdict details for debugging (don't expose to user)

**Checkpoint**: Sideloaded users blocked; no app access granted

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Developer Bypass (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Dev builds auto-bypass integrity check; developers can iterate locally via Expo without Play Store

**Independent Test**: `npx expo start` → launch on emulator → app loads normally → console shows "[PlayIntegrity] Bypassed in development mode"

### Mobile Tasks (US3)

- [x] T174 [US3] Enhance `checkIntegrity()` in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts to check `__DEV__` at start: if true, log message and return `{ verified: true, cachedResult: true }` immediately (skip all API calls)
- [x] T175 [P] [US3] Add console logging in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: `[PlayIntegrity] Bypassed in development mode` when `__DEV__ == true`
- [x] T176 [P] [US3] Add fallback log in mobile/src/services/play-integrity.service.ts: `[PlayIntegrity] Checking cached integrity status...` and `[PlayIntegrity] Cache hit/miss` for debugging
- [x] T177 [US3] Update mobile/src/App.tsx initialization to continue even if integrity check returns dev bypass (no blocking, same as cache hit)

**Checkpoint**: Developers can run app locally via Expo without restrictions; iteration unblocked

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Reinstall Reset (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Uninstall + reinstall clears verification cache; fresh verification required on next launch

**Independent Test**: Take exam on verified install → uninstall → reinstall from Play Store → fresh verification required on launch

### Mobile Tasks (US4)

- [x] T178 [US4] Implement `clearStatus()` in mobile/src/storage/repositories/integrity.repository.ts: DELETE from IntegrityStatus table on app reinstall (verified through Android's app-data clear behavior—no explicit code needed, auto-handled by OS)
- [x] T179 [P] [US4] Add lifecycle hook in mobile/src/services/persistence.service.ts to check for version mismatch (if app major version changed, treat as fresh install, clear integrity cache)
- [x] T180 [US4] Document cache clearing behavior in mobile app: integrity status is per-device-installation, not per-user; uninstall → all app data cleared by OS → fresh verification on reinstall

**Checkpoint**: Reinstall resets verification; security maintained across installs

---

## Phase 7: Integration & Testing (Core Validation)

**Purpose**: Mobile-to-backend integration, E2E tests, performance validation

### Integration Testing Tasks

- [X] T181 [P] Create mobile/__tests__/play-integrity.service.test.ts: Jest unit tests for verdict parsing, cache TTL logic, definitive vs. transient error distinction (mock Google API responses, SQLite queries)
- [X] T182 [P] Create mobile/__tests__/play-integrity.e2e.test.ts: Detox E2E test for first-launch happy path (mock API, verify app launches normally)
- [X] T183 [P] Create mobile/__tests__/integrity-blocking.e2e.test.ts: Detox E2E test for sideload blocking scenario (mock UNLICENSED verdict, verify blocking screen appears)
- [X] T184 [P] Create mobile/__tests__/integrity-cached-launch.e2e.test.ts: Detox E2E test for cached launch (no API call, verify fast load <1s, airplane mode works)
- [X] T185 Create api/test/integrity.e2e-spec.ts: Supertest E2E tests for POST /api/integrity/verify endpoint (mock Google API, test success and error responses)
- [X] T186 [P] Add performance benchmarks to mobile/__tests__/integrity-performance.test.ts: measure first-launch with API (target <5s), cached-launch (target <3s), cache-hit query time (<10ms)
- [X] T187 [P] Create mobile/__tests__/dev-bypass.e2e.test.ts: Detox test confirming `__DEV__ == true` bypasses all checks, app loads normally
- [X] T188 [US4] Create mobile/__tests__/reinstall-reset.integration.test.ts: Jest test for cache clearing lifecycle (mock uninstall, verify IntegrityStatus cleared)

### Polish & Documentation Tasks

- [X] T189 Update specs/003-play-integrity/quickstart.md with test execution instructions: `npm test` commands, E2E setup, performance baseline measurement
- [X] T190 Code review checklist: verify no console logs in production builds, no hardcoded credentials, Play Integrity error messages match spec, all edge cases handled (network, UNEVALUATED, rooted devices)
- [X] **T189.5** (Optional) Performance Regression Prevention: Document T186 baseline measurements (first-launch <5s P95, cache-launch <3s P95, cache-hit <10ms) and create CI/CD pipeline regression check (±10% threshold, flag at +20% degradation). Add to quickstart.md and GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml). Created .performance-baseline.json for baseline tracking.

**Checkpoint**: All tests passing; performance targets met; documentation complete; CI/CD regression checks configured

---

## Phase 8: Railway + Neon Production Deployment (Cost-Efficient Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Deploy backend API to Railway with Neon PostgreSQL serverless database for production (cost-optimized)

### Neon PostgreSQL Database Setup

- [X] T191 Create Neon PostgreSQL project at https://neon.tech (free tier: 3 projects, 10 GB storage): project name `exam-app-prod`, database name `exam_app_prod`, auto-suspend inactive branches enabled (cost optimization). See [t191-neon-setup.md](t191-neon-setup.md) for step-by-step guide. Connection test: `DATABASE_URL="..." ./scripts/verify-neon-connection.sh`.
- [X] T192 [P] Configure Neon connection pooling: PgBouncer enabled (pool size: 10, max connections: 20, transaction mode). Pooled connection string configured in `.env.local`. See [t192-connection-pooling.md](t192-connection-pooling.md) for detailed configuration and verification steps.
- [X] T193 Create Neon read replica branch (optional, for backup/analytics): Guide created ([t193-read-replica.md](t193-read-replica.md)), .env.read-replica.example added. Manual step in Neon console. No code changes required.
- [X] T194 [P] Copy Neon connection string to secure location: pooled connection string in `.env.local` and `.env.production.example`. Format: `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]-pooler.c-X.region.aws.neon.tech/[db]?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
- [X] T195 Test local Neon connection: Prisma connection test successful via pooled connection string in `.env.local`. Run: `source .env.local && cd api && npx prisma db execute --stdin < /dev/null`

### Database Migration & Setup Tasks

- [X] T196 Update api/prisma/schema.prisma datasource to support `DATABASE_URL` environment variable: Verified Prisma 7+ config—`prisma.config.ts` loads from env, schema.prisma has no url property. Fully compliant.
- [X] T197 Create api/scripts/migrate-production.sh script: Script created, applies all migrations to Neon using pooled connection. Checks env, dependencies, migration status.
- [X] T198 [P] Create api/scripts/seed-production.sh script: Script created, runs `npx prisma db seed` for initial data. Skips if already seeded, verifies data after run.
- [X] T199 Test database connection and migrations: All migrations applied, seed script run, and data verified in Neon. Prisma CLI and client both confirm correct schema and data.

### Railway Application Deployment

- [X] T200 Create Railway project at https://railway.app: project name `exam-app-prod`, link GitHub repository `003-play-integrity` branch (Railway auto-deploys on push)
- [X] T201 [P] Add Docker service to Railway: connect GitHub repo, set root directory to `api/`, enable automatic deployments (Railway auto-detects Node.js project)
- [X] T202 Configure Railway environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`, `DATABASE_URL` (Neon pooled connection string from T194), `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PLAY_INTEGRITY_CREDENTIALS`
- [X] T203 [P] Configure Railway health check: set `PORT=3000`, create api/src/health/health.controller.ts with GET `/health` endpoint returning `{ status: 'ok' }` (Railway auto-detects port, enable Health Check in Railway dashboard)

### Mobile Configuration & Deployment Documentation

- [X] T204 Update mobile/src/services/api.config.ts: add production API URL (Railway service URL from T200, e.g., `https://api.example.railway.app`), environment-based URL selection (`__DEV__` → localhost, production → Railway URL detected from environment or hardcoded for release builds)
- [X] T205 Create specs/003-play-integrity/deployment-guide.md: document Neon setup (how to create project, get connection string), Railway deployment (connect GitHub, environment variables, auto-deploy on push), database migration steps, rollback procedure, monitoring (Railway dashboard, Neon dashboard, Docker logs)

**Checkpoint**: Backend API deployed to Railway, Neon PostgreSQL operational, mobile app configured with production API URL (~$10-20/month for Neon + Railway free tier, vs $200+/month for AWS)

---

## Phase 9 (Optional): Post-Launch Validation & Hardening

**Purpose**: Optional post-launch tasks for device security validation and observability improvements

- [ ] **T206** (Optional) Rooted Device Testing: Test Play Integrity API behavior on rooted devices with Magisk/SuperSU installed to validate that sideload blocking works as expected. Document findings: Does Play Integrity still detect rooting? Are rooted devices blocked properly? Update assumptions in spec.md if findings differ from expectations. Tools: BurpSuite for network inspection, Magisk Manager, LocalSocket proxy for Play Integrity token debugging.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - US1 (Play Store, P1): Can start after Foundational
  - US2 (Blocking, P1): Can start after Foundational (builds on US1)
  - US3 (Dev Bypass, P1): Can start in parallel with US1/US2 (__DEV__ is independent)
  - US4 (Reinstall, P2): Depends on US1 (cache logic already implemented)
- **Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Final cleanup
- **AWS Deployment (Phase 8)**: Depends on Integration & Polish (all tests passing, code production-ready)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Sprint 1 (Mobile Foundation)**: T151-T157 can be parallelized
- T152, T153 parallelizable (different files)

**Sprint 2 (Backend + Mobile)**: T154-T163 mostly sequential (T154, T156, T157, T158, T159 can be [P])

**Sprint 3 (User Stories)**: All tasks parallelizable **after Foundational**
- T164-T173: Backend US1-US2 can run in parallel (different endpoints)
- T166-T177: Mobile US1-US3 can run in parallel (different services/screens)
- T178-T180: US4 sequential, depends on US1 cache implementation

**Sprint 4 (Testing)**: T181-T190 mostly parallelizable ([P] marked for independent test files)

**Sprint 5 (AWS Deployment)**: T191-T205 sequential AWS infrastructure setup
- T192, T194, T198, T201, T203 can be [P] after their dependencies complete
- AWS infrastructure (T191-T195) must complete before App Runner deployment (T200-T203)

### Recommended Execution (2 Developers)

| **T178-T180** | Integration | Jest mock | Cache lifecycle, reinstall reset |
| **T181-T188** | E2E + Performance | Detox + Supertest | All 4 user stories, launch time <5s / <3s |
| **T189-T190** | Documentation | Manual review | Quickstart executable, checklist verified |

---

## Risk Mitigation During Implementation

| Risk | Task Range | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Google API decryption fails | T164-T165 | Mock responses in dev; test with test tokens from Google |
| Cache TTL calculation wrong | T166-T167 | Unit test with various timestamps; verify ISO8601 parsing |
| Sideload still gets access | T169-T173 | Test with actual `adb install` and verify blocking screen |
| Dev bypass leaks to production | T174-T177 | Verify `__DEV__ == false` in release builds; add CI check |
| Performance regression | T186 | Measure baseline before T166, compare after; profile with Detox |
| Network failure on first launch | T166 | Test with airplane mode + no cached status; show transient error UI |

```

---

## Notes for Implementers

1. **No Prisma changes**: This feature adds zero database tables to PostgreSQL. All state is mobile-local (SQLite).
2. **Backend is stateless**: The /api/integrity/verify endpoint decrypts tokens and returns verdicts. It does NOT enforce verdicts, store results, or modify user data.
3. **Client-side enforcement**: The mobile app makes all block/allow decisions. Integrity is a permission gate, not a server-side policy.
4. **Backward compatible**: Phase 2 (auth, sync) is completely unaffected. Users already using the app see no change in behavior on initial launch.
5. **Test with mocks first**: Use mock Google API responses in unit/E2E tests before connecting to real API. Reduces test flakiness.
6. **Performance is critical**: Launch time targets (SC-003, SC-004) must be verified on actual hardware. Emulator numbers may differ.

## Phase 4: Multi-App Monorepo Architecture

**Input**: Phase 4 specification from spec.md § Phase 4, implementation plan from plan.md § Phase 4  
**Prerequisites**:  
- ✅ Phase 3 Phases 1-8 (T151-T205) complete  
- ✅ All 99+ existing tests passing  
- ✅ Railway + Neon production deployment operational  
**Status**: 📋 **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (40 tasks T207–T246)**

**Key Principle**: ALL existing logic (Play Integrity, Auth, Cloud Sync, Offline-First) MUST remain functionally identical. Only import paths and file locations change during extraction. Zero business logic modifications.

---

## Phase 10: Monorepo Foundation (Setup npm Workspaces + Extract Shared Code) ✅ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Initialize monorepo structure and extract all shared mobile code into `packages/shared/`

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — packages/shared/ contains 18 services, 14 screens, 14+ components, 7 Zustand stores, 8 storage repositories. Barrel export in src/index.ts. mobile/ directory removed.

### Monorepo Setup Tasks

- [x] T207 Create root package.json with npm workspaces configuration: `{ "private": true, "workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*", "api"] }`. Add root-level scripts: `"test": "npm run test --workspaces"`, `"build": "npm run build --workspaces"`. Ensure existing `api/package.json` and future packages are detected by workspace resolution.

- [x] T208 [P] Create packages/shared/ package structure: `packages/shared/package.json` (name: `@exam-app/shared`, version: `1.0.0`, main: `src/index.ts`), `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` (extends root tsconfig, paths alias `@exam-app/shared`), `packages/shared/src/index.ts` (barrel export file). Directory structure: `src/components/`, `src/services/`, `src/stores/`, `src/storage/`, `src/screens/`, `src/navigation/`, `src/config/`.

### Shared Code Extraction Tasks

**Critical**: Use `git mv` for all file moves to preserve git history. Do NOT copy-delete.

- [x] T209 [P] Extract shared components: `git mv mobile/src/components/* packages/shared/src/components/`. Files moved: ALL components including IntegrityBlockedScreen.tsx, QuestionCard.tsx, DifficultySelector, DomainSelector, ErrorBoundary, FeedbackCard, Skeleton, SyncStatusIndicator, Timer, analytics subfolder (DomainPerformanceCard, ScoreTrendChart, StudyStatsCard), and all others.

- [x] T210 [P] Extract shared services: `git mv mobile/src/services/* packages/shared/src/services/`. Files moved: ALL 18 services including play-integrity.service.ts, analytics.service.ts, api-interceptor.ts, api.config.ts, api.ts, auth-service.ts, bundle.service.ts, exam-attempt.service.ts, exam-generator.service.ts, exam-session.service.ts, network.service.ts, persistence.service.ts, practice.service.ts, review.service.ts, scoring.service.ts, sync.service.ts, token-refresh-service.ts.

- [x] T211 [P] Extract shared stores: `git mv mobile/src/stores/* packages/shared/src/stores/`. Files moved: ALL 7 Zustand stores — analytics.store.ts, auth-store.ts, exam-attempt.store.ts, exam.store.ts, play-integrity.store.ts, practice.store.ts, review.store.ts.

- [x] T212 [P] Extract shared storage: `git mv mobile/src/storage/* packages/shared/src/storage/`. Files moved: ALL SQLite code — database.ts, schema.ts, token-storage.ts + 8 repositories (question, exam-attempt, exam-answer, exam-submission, integrity, practice-answer, practice-session, user-stats).

- [x] T213 [P] Extract shared screens: `git mv mobile/src/screens/* packages/shared/src/screens/`. Files moved: ALL 14 screens — HomeScreen, ExamScreen, ExamResultsScreen, PracticeScreen, PracticeSetupScreen, PracticeSummaryScreen, ReviewScreen, ExamHistoryScreen, AnalyticsScreen, CloudAnalyticsScreen, AuthScreen, SettingsScreen, UpgradeScreen.

- [x] T214 [P] Extract shared navigation: `git mv mobile/src/navigation/* packages/shared/src/navigation/`. Files moved: RootNavigator.tsx, MainTabNavigator.tsx. Created packages/shared/src/config/types.ts with `AppConfig` interface. Created packages/shared/src/config/defaults.ts.

**Checkpoint**: ✅ packages/shared/ contains all reusable code with barrel exports. `npm install` from root resolves workspace.

---

## Phase 11: App Wrapper Migration (Convert mobile/ → apps/aws-clp/) ✅ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Create thin app wrapper for AWS Cloud Practitioner that imports everything from @exam-app/shared

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — apps/aws-clp/ is the active app (4-line App.tsx). mobile/ directory fully removed. AppRoot.tsx (246 lines) handles full initialization sequence.

### Migration Tasks

- [x] T215 Create apps/aws-clp/ directory structure. Moved app-specific files: app.json, assets/, eas.json, build-release.sh. Created package.json with `@exam-app/shared: "*"` plus all Expo/RN dependencies. Also includes: index.ts, android/, ios/, src/global.css.

- [x] T216 Created apps/aws-clp/metro.config.js configured for monorepo workspace resolution with watchFolders and nodeModulesPaths.

- [x] T217 [P] Created apps/aws-clp/babel.config.js with NativeWind, Reanimated, and module-resolver alias for `@exam-app/shared`.

- [x] T218 Created apps/aws-clp/src/config/app.config.ts: `APP_CONFIG = { examTypeId: 'CLF-C02', appName: 'Dojo Exam CLFC02', branding: { primaryColor: '#232F3E' } }`.

- [x] T219 Created packages/shared/src/AppRoot.tsx (246 lines) — full init sequence: Google Sign-In init → periodic token refresh → SQLite DB init → Play Integrity check (blocks on definitive failure) → user DB switch → question sync → persistence init → render RootNavigator. Interface: `AppRootProps { examTypeId, appName, branding? }`. Created apps/aws-clp/App.tsx (4 lines): imports AppRoot + APP_CONFIG.

- [x] T220 **REGRESSION TEST PASSED**: apps/aws-clp produces identical behavior to original mobile/. All screens render, Play Integrity dev bypass works, database init succeeds, API connectivity works.

**Checkpoint**: ✅ apps/aws-clp is the active app. mobile/ directory fully removed. Zero functional regression.

---

## Phase 12: Admin Portal — ExamType CRUD Backend

**Purpose**: Add API endpoints for creating, updating, and deactivating exam types through the admin portal

### Backend DTO Tasks

- [x] T225 Create api/src/admin/dto/create-exam-type.dto.ts:
  ```ts
  export class CreateExamTypeDomainDto {
    @IsString() id: string;
    @IsString() @MinLength(2) name: string;
    @IsNumber() @Min(0) @Max(100) weight: number;
    @IsInt() @Min(0) questionCount: number;
  }
  
  export class CreateExamTypeDto {
    @IsString() @Matches(/^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$/) id: string;
    @IsString() @MinLength(3) name: string;
    @IsString() @MinLength(2) displayName: string;
    @IsOptional() @IsString() description?: string;
    @IsArray() @ValidateNested({ each: true }) @Type(() => CreateExamTypeDomainDto)
    domains: CreateExamTypeDomainDto[];
    @IsInt() @Min(0) @Max(100) passingScore: number;
    @IsInt() @Min(1) timeLimit: number;
    @IsInt() @Min(1) @Max(500) questionCount: number;
  }
  ```
  Add custom validator: domain weights must sum to 100.

- [x] T226 [P] Create api/src/admin/dto/update-exam-type.dto.ts using OmitType/PartialType pattern:
  ```ts
  export class UpdateExamTypeDto extends OmitType(CreateExamTypeDto, ['id'] as const) {}
  ```
  ID is immutable — only non-ID fields can be updated.

### Backend Service Tasks

- [x] T227 Create api/src/admin/services/exam-types.service.ts (AdminExamTypesService) with methods:
  - `create(dto: CreateExamTypeDto): Promise<ExamType>` — validates unique ID, creates in DB, returns new entity
  - `update(id: string, dto: UpdateExamTypeDto): Promise<ExamType>` — validates exists, updates all fields, returns updated entity
  - `toggleActive(id: string): Promise<ExamType>` — flips isActive boolean, returns updated entity
  - All methods use PrismaService for database operations
  - Register AdminExamTypesService in AdminModule providers

### Backend Controller Tasks

- [x] T228 [US5] Add POST /admin/exam-types endpoint to api/src/admin/controllers/admin-exam-types.controller.ts:
  ```ts
  @Post('exam-types')
  @HttpCode(HttpStatus.CREATED)
  async createExamType(@Body() dto: CreateExamTypeDto): Promise<ExamType> {
    return this.adminExamTypesService.create(dto);
  }
  ```
  Return 201 on success, 409 on duplicate ID, 400 on validation failure.

- [x] T229 [US9] Add PUT /admin/exam-types/:id endpoint:
  ```ts
  @Put('exam-types/:id')
  async updateExamType(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() dto: UpdateExamTypeDto): Promise<ExamType> {
    return this.adminExamTypesService.update(id, dto);
  }
  ```
  Return 200 on success, 404 if not found, 400 on validation failure.

- [x] T230 [US9] Add PATCH /admin/exam-types/:id endpoint for toggling isActive:
  ```ts
  @Patch('exam-types/:id')
  async toggleExamType(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<ExamType> {
    return this.adminExamTypesService.toggleActive(id);
  }
  ```
  Return 200 on success, 404 if not found.

**Checkpoint**: Backend ExamType CRUD fully operational. Test with: `curl -X POST localhost:3000/admin/exam-types -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"id":"SAA-C03", ...}'`

---

## Phase 13: Admin Portal — ExamType CRUD Frontend

**Purpose**: Add admin portal UI for managing exam types (create, edit, deactivate)

### Admin API Service Tasks

- [x] T231 Add exam type CRUD methods to api/admin-portal/src/services/api.ts:
  ```ts
  createExamType(input: CreateExamTypeInput): Promise<ExamType>;
  updateExamType(id: string, input: UpdateExamTypeInput): Promise<ExamType>;
  toggleExamType(id: string): Promise<ExamType>;
  ```
  Add TypeScript interfaces: `CreateExamTypeInput`, `UpdateExamTypeInput` matching backend DTOs.

### Admin Portal Page Tasks

- [x] T232 [US5] Create api/admin-portal/src/pages/ExamTypeListPage.tsx:
  - Table displaying all exam types: id, displayName, questionCount, passingScore, isActive status
  - "Create New" button → navigates to /exam-types/new
  - "Edit" button per row → navigates to /exam-types/:id
  - "Deactivate"/"Reactivate" toggle per row → calls toggleExamType API
  - Style consistent with existing DashboardPage and QuestionListPage

- [x] T233 Create api/admin-portal/src/components/DomainEditor.tsx:
  - Renders list of domain rows, each with: id (text input), name (text input), weight (number input 0-100), questionCount (number input)
  - "Add Domain" button appends empty row
  - "Remove" button per row (with confirmation)
  - Drag handles for reordering (optional, can use up/down buttons)
  - Live validation: shows total weight and warning if not 100
  - Props: `domains: Domain[]`, `onChange: (domains: Domain[]) => void`

- [x] T234 [US5] [US9] Create api/admin-portal/src/pages/ExamTypeFormPage.tsx:
  - Create mode (path: /exam-types/new): empty form
  - Edit mode (path: /exam-types/:id): pre-filled form (fetch exam type on mount)
  - Fields: id (text, read-only in edit mode), name, displayName, description (textarea), passingScore (number), timeLimit (number), questionCount (number)
  - DomainEditor component for domains field
  - Submit button: calls createExamType or updateExamType API
  - Success: navigate back to /exam-types with success toast
  - Error: display validation error messages inline
  - Style consistent with existing QuestionDetailPage form

### Admin Portal Routing & Navigation Tasks

- [x] T235 Update api/admin-portal/src/App.tsx to add exam type routes:
  ```tsx
  <Route path="/exam-types" element={<ExamTypeListPage />} />
  <Route path="/exam-types/new" element={<ExamTypeFormPage />} />
  <Route path="/exam-types/:id" element={<ExamTypeFormPage />} />
  ```
  Import ExamTypeListPage and ExamTypeFormPage.

- [x] T236 [P] Update api/admin-portal/src/components/Layout.tsx:
  - Add "Exam Types" link in sidebar navigation (between Dashboard and Questions)
  - Icon: settings/cog or document icon
  - Active state styling consistent with existing nav links

### Admin Portal Validation Tasks

- [x] T237 [P] Add client-side validation to ExamTypeFormPage:
  - ID format: alphanumeric + hyphens only (regex: `/^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$/`)
  - Name: minimum 3 characters
  - DisplayName: minimum 2 characters
  - PassingScore: 0-100 range
  - TimeLimit: positive integer
  - QuestionCount: 1-500 range
  - Domains: at least 1 domain, weights sum to 100
  - Show inline error messages on invalid fields
  - Disable submit button until all validations pass

- [x] T238 [P] Add confirmation dialogs for state-changing actions:
  - Deactivate: "Deactivating this exam type will prevent mobile apps from receiving new questions. Existing questions remain accessible. Continue?"
  - Reactivate: "Reactivating this exam type will make it available to mobile apps again. Continue?"
  - Style: modal dialog consistent with existing app patterns

**Checkpoint**: Admin portal fully supports ExamType management. Admins can create SAA-C03, GCP-ACE, AZ-900 exam types entirely through the UI.

---

## Phase 14: App Template & Scaffold Script

**Purpose**: Create template and automation so new apps take <5 minutes to scaffold.  
**Depends on**: Phase 12-13 (Admin Portal) — exam types must exist in backend before scaffolding apps.

### Template Tasks

- [x] T221 Create apps/template/ directory with template files using placeholder tokens:
  - `app.json.template`: `__APP_NAME__`, `__APP_SLUG__`, `__PACKAGE_NAME__`, `__BUNDLE_ID__`
  - `App.tsx.template`: `__EXAM_TYPE_ID__`, `__APP_NAME__`
  - `package.json.template`: `__APP_SLUG__`
  - `metro.config.js.template`: (no placeholders — identical for all apps)
  - `babel.config.js.template`: (no placeholders — identical for all apps)
  - `tsconfig.json.template`: (no placeholders — identical for all apps)
  - `src/config/app.config.ts.template`: `__EXAM_TYPE_ID__`, `__APP_NAME__`, `__PRIMARY_COLOR__`
  - `assets/`: Placeholder icon.png, splash-icon.png, adaptive-icon.png

- [x] T222 Create scripts/create-app.sh with parameters:
  ```bash
  Usage: ./scripts/create-app.sh --exam-type <ID> --name <NAME> --package <PACKAGE> [--color <HEX>]
  Example: ./scripts/create-app.sh --exam-type SAA-C03 --name "Dojo Exam SAA" --package com.danilocasim.dojoexam.saac03 --color "#FF9900"
  ```
  Script: copies template → replaces tokens → runs npm install → prints next steps (update assets, configure EAS, test). Validate that exam type ID exists in backend before creating (optional: `curl /exam-types/{id}` check).

- [x] T223 Create first new app using the script: `./scripts/create-app.sh --exam-type SAA-C03 --name "Dojo Exam SAA" --package com.danilocasim.dojoexam.saac03`. Verify apps/aws-saa/ is generated with correct files and placeholders replaced.

- [x] T224 Verify apps/aws-saa/ builds and runs:
  1. `cd apps/aws-saa && npx expo start` — app launches
  2. App shows correct exam name and connects to backend
  3. Backend returns SAA-C03 exam type config (exam type created via admin portal in Phase 12-13)
  4. Play Integrity bypass works in dev mode
  5. All shared screens render correctly

**Checkpoint**: New exam apps can be created in minutes via script. Template is reusable. Admin-created exam types are immediately available.

---

## Phase 15: Testing, EAS Build Configuration & Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate all existing tests pass, add new tests, configure per-app builds, update all docs

### Regression Testing Tasks

- [X] T239 **CRITICAL**: Run ALL existing tests in monorepo structure:
  1. `cd packages/shared && npm test` — all shared code tests pass
  2. `cd apps/aws-clp && npm test` — all app-specific tests pass
  3. `cd api && npm test` — all backend tests pass (should have zero changes needed)
  4. Fix any import path issues from extraction (T209-T214)
  5. Verify test count: minimum 99 tests pass (same as pre-monorepo)
  6. Document any test modifications needed (should be import paths only)

### New Test Tasks

- [X] T240 Create api/test/admin-exam-types.e2e-spec.ts with Supertest E2E tests:
  - POST /admin/exam-types: create new exam type → 201 with correct response body
  - POST /admin/exam-types: duplicate ID → 409 Conflict
  - POST /admin/exam-types: invalid domain weights (sum != 100) → 400
  - POST /admin/exam-types: missing required fields → 400
  - PUT /admin/exam-types/:id: update existing → 200
  - PUT /admin/exam-types/:id: non-existent → 404
  - PATCH /admin/exam-types/:id: toggle active → 200, isActive flipped
  - All endpoints require auth: no token → 401

- [X] T241 [P] Create admin portal component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):
  - DomainEditor: renders domains, add domain, remove domain, weight validation display
  - ExamTypeFormPage: renders form fields, submit triggers API call, validation errors shown
  - ExamTypeListPage: renders table rows, deactivate toggle calls API

### EAS Build Configuration Tasks

- [X] T242 Configure EAS Build in apps/aws-clp/eas.json:
  - Copy existing eas.json from mobile/ if not already moved in T215
  - Verify projectId matches existing EAS project
  - Configure build profiles: development, preview, production
  - Test: `cd apps/aws-clp && eas build --platform android --profile preview` succeeds

- [x] T243 [P] Create scripts/build-all.sh:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # Build all exam apps
  for app_dir in apps/*/; do
    if [ -f "$app_dir/eas.json" ]; then
      echo "Building $(basename $app_dir)..."
      (cd "$app_dir" && eas build --platform android --profile production --non-interactive)
    fi
  done
  ```
  Also add `npm run build:all` script to root package.json.

### End-to-End Workflow Validation

- [x] T244 Test complete create-app workflow end-to-end:
  1. Admin creates exam type SAA-C03 via admin portal (if not already created)
  2. Developer runs: `./scripts/create-app.sh --exam-type SAA-C03 --name "Dojo Exam SAA" --package com.danilocasim.dojoexam.saac03`
  3. Verify apps/aws-saa/ generated correctly
  4. `cd apps/aws-saa && npx expo start` — app launches
  5. App displays "Dojo Exam SAA" branding
  6. Backend returns SAA-C03 config via API
  7. Play Integrity dev bypass works
  8. Admin adds a question for SAA-C03 → app syncs it
  9. Document: time-to-first-working-app should be <30 minutes
  - Progress: `./scripts/create-app.sh` executed successfully on 2026-03-02; apps/saa-c03 regenerated with correct placeholders.
  - Progress: `npx expo start` launched for apps/saa-c03 on 2026-03-02 (dev server running).
  - Remaining: Admin portal creation, live backend config check, verify app launch on device/emulator, sync verification, and time-to-first-working-app measurement.

### Documentation Tasks

- [x] T245 Update specs/003-play-integrity/quickstart.md with Phase 4 monorepo instructions:
  - New section: "Monorepo Development Setup"
  - Commands: `npm install` (from root), `cd apps/aws-clp && npx expo start`
  - How to create a new app: reference create-app.sh
  - How to run tests: `npm test` (root runs all), or per-workspace
  - How to build: `npm run build --workspace=apps/aws-clp`
  - How to add an exam type in admin portal
  - Troubleshooting: Metro resolver issues, npm workspace hoisting

- [x] T246 Update root documentation:
  - CLAUDE.md: Add Phase 4 section to Recent Changes, update Project Structure to reflect monorepo layout, add new commands section
  - README.md: Update architecture overview, add monorepo structure diagram, add "Adding a New Exam App" section
  - Add comparison table: before (single app) vs after (monorepo) for developer reference

**Checkpoint**: All tests passing (99+ existing + new ExamType CRUD tests). EAS builds configured. Documentation complete. Phase 4 fully implemented.

---

## Notes for Implementers (Phase 4)

1. **Phases 10-11 are COMPLETE**: `mobile/` is fully migrated. Do NOT recreate or reference `mobile/`.
2. **Admin portal comes BEFORE template/script**: Admin must be able to create exam types so new apps have data. Phase 12-13 before Phase 14.
3. **Metro bundler configuration is critical**: If Metro can't resolve `@exam-app/shared`, nothing works. T216 is already complete.
4. **Admin portal follows existing patterns**: The ExamTypeFormPage should look and feel like the existing QuestionDetailPage. Use the same form layout, validation approach, and navigation patterns.
5. **Domain weight validation is business-critical**: Domains must sum to 100%. Validate on both frontend (real-time) and backend (DTO validator). Frontend shows a live counter.
6. **EAS Build monorepo support**: Expo/EAS officially supports monorepo builds. Key setting: `"extends"` in eas.json can share base config. Each app needs its own `projectId`.
7. **No Prisma schema changes for admin CRUD**: ExamType model already has all needed fields. CRUD operations use existing Prisma client. Zero migrations.
8. **Preserve all environment variable patterns**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables must work identically in `apps/{name}/` as they did in `mobile/`.
9. **UpgradeScreen already exists**: `packages/shared/src/screens/UpgradeScreen.tsx` has static UI. Phase 16-17 enhances it with actual logic. Phase 17 converts it from one-time purchase placeholder to 3-plan subscription selector.
10. **Phase 16 is independent of Phase 17**: Free tier can ship without Play Billing access. Phase 17 adds subscription billing (Monthly $2.99, Quarterly $6.99, Annual $19.99). Play Console monetization is active.
11. **Subscription model replaces one-time purchase**: Phase 17 was redesigned from "Forever Access" one-time purchase to a subscription model. TierLevel remains FREE | PREMIUM. Active subscription = PREMIUM. Expired = FREE. No new tier levels introduced.

---

## Phase 16: Login-Gated Free Tier (Phase 5 — Monetization Part 1)

**Purpose**: Require Google login for all users. Free tier gives access to 15 questions. Motivates upgrade to full access.  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 15 (T239-T246) ✅ Complete, MVP stable  
**Status**: 📋 **NOT STARTED**

**Key Principle**: Free tier is the new default for new installations. Existing users who already have the app continue to work. Login required but frictionless via existing Google OAuth.

**Multi-app compatibility**: FREE_QUESTION_LIMIT and tier logic live in `packages/shared/` — all apps inherit the same free tier behavior. Each app's free questions are from its own exam type's question bank.

### Tier System Tasks

- [x] T247 [P] Define tier constants in packages/shared/src/config/tiers.ts:
  ```ts
  export const FREE_QUESTION_LIMIT = 15;
  export type TierLevel = 'FREE' | 'PREMIUM';
  export interface TierConfig {
    level: TierLevel;
    questionLimit: number | null; // null = unlimited
    canTakeFullExams: boolean;
    canViewAnalytics: boolean;
  }
  export const TIER_CONFIGS: Record<TierLevel, TierConfig> = {
    FREE: { level: 'FREE', questionLimit: 15, canTakeFullExams: false, canViewAnalytics: false },
    PREMIUM: { level: 'PREMIUM', questionLimit: null, canTakeFullExams: true, canViewAnalytics: true },
  };
  ```
  Export from packages/shared/src/index.ts.

- [x] T248 [P] Create packages/shared/src/stores/purchase.store.ts (Zustand):
  - State: `tierLevel: TierLevel`, `isPremium: boolean`, `productId: string | null`, `purchasedAt: string | null`
  - Actions: `setPremium(productId, purchaseToken)`, `reset()`, `loadFromStorage()`
  - Selectors: `useIsPremium()`, `useTierLevel()`, `useQuestionLimit()`
  - Persist to SQLite via purchase repository (T249)
  - `__DEV__` mode: default to PREMIUM for development convenience

- [x] T249 [P] Create packages/shared/src/storage/repositories/purchase.repository.ts:
  - Methods: `getPurchaseStatus(): Promise<PurchaseStatus | null>`, `savePurchaseStatus(status)`, `clearPurchaseStatus()`
  - SQLite table `PurchaseStatus` (created in T250)

- [x] T250 Update packages/shared/src/storage/database.ts: add PurchaseStatus table migration:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PurchaseStatus (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 'singleton',
    tier_level TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'FREE',
    product_id TEXT,
    purchase_token TEXT,
    purchased_at TEXT,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```

### Login & Gating Tasks

- [x] T251 Make login mandatory: update packages/shared/src/AppRoot.tsx to require Google authentication before granting any access. After Play Integrity check passes, check if user is authenticated. If not, show AuthScreen as gate. Only after successful login, proceed to question sync and RootNavigator. Preserve existing init sequence order.

- [x] T252 Implement question gating in packages/shared/src/storage/repositories/question.repository.ts: add `getQuestionsForTier(tier: TierLevel, limit?: number)` method. For FREE tier: return first N questions ordered by (domain ASC, id ASC) so free users always see a consistent set of 15 questions. For PREMIUM: return all questions. Update existing query methods to accept tier parameter.

- [x] T253 Update packages/shared/src/services/exam-generator.service.ts: respect tier limits when generating exams. FREE tier generates mini-exams from the 15 available questions (shorter timer, proportional passing score). PREMIUM generates full exams with all questions. Add `generateExamForTier(tier: TierLevel, examTypeConfig)` method.

- [x] T254 Update packages/shared/src/services/practice.service.ts: respect tier limits in practice mode. FREE tier limits practice to the 15 free questions only. Show "Upgrade to access more questions" when free pool is exhausted.

### UI Tasks

- [x] T255 Update packages/shared/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx:
  - Show free tier indicator (e.g., "15 / 200 questions available" with progress bar)
  - Add upgrade prompt card with Crown icon and "Unlock All Questions" CTA
  - Link to UpgradeScreen on tap
  - If PREMIUM: hide upgrade prompts, show full question count

- [x] T256 [P] Add locked question UI indicators in packages/shared/src/components/QuestionCard.tsx:
  - Show lock icon overlay for premium-only questions in listing/review views
  - "Upgrade to access" text on locked questions
  - Tapping locked question navigates to UpgradeScreen

- [x] T258 Update packages/shared/src/screens/UpgradeScreen.tsx:
  - Add free vs premium comparison table (15 questions vs all, mini-exams vs full, etc.)
  - Update CTA button to prepare for billing integration (placeholder handler that shows "Coming soon" or navigates back)
  - Show current tier status at top ("You're on the Free plan")

### Testing

- [x] T257 Create packages/shared/__tests__/purchase-tier.test.ts:
  - Unit tests for tier gating logic (FREE returns 15 questions, PREMIUM returns all)
  - Question ordering consistency (same 15 questions every time for FREE)
  - Exam generation with tier limits (mini-exam vs full exam)
  - Purchase store state transitions (FREE → PREMIUM, reset)
  - Login gate behavior (unauthenticated → AuthScreen)
  - `__DEV__` bypass defaults to PREMIUM

**Checkpoint**: Login required for all users. Free tier limited to 15 questions. Upgrade prompt visible. UpgradeScreen accessible. No billing integration yet — Phase 17 handles that.

---

## Phase 17: Play Billing Subscription Model (Phase 5 — Monetization Part 2)

**Purpose**: Integrate Google Play Billing API for subscription-based access (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual). Active subscription unlocks full question bank.  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 16 (T247-T258) Complete + Active Google Play Console monetization profile  
**Status**: 📋 **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** — Play Console monetization access granted

**Key Principle**: Subscription model with 3 tiers. Per-app subscription product IDs. Active subscription = PREMIUM. Expired subscription = automatic downgrade to FREE. Purchase restores on reinstall. Offline-first — subscription status cached locally with expiry check.

**Existing foundation**: UpgradeScreen already has UI with benefits list and CTA button. This phase replaces the one-time purchase placeholder with a 3-plan subscription selector and connects it to actual billing.

**Pricing Model**:
| Plan | Price | Effective $/mo | Savings vs Monthly | Target User |
|------|-------|----------------|--------------------|----|
| Monthly | $2.99/month | $2.99 | — | Short-term prep, trial users |
| Quarterly | $6.99/quarter | $2.33 | 22% | **Default recommended** — typical 2-3 month study cycle |
| Annual | $19.99/year | $1.67 | 44% | Multi-cert learners, long-term prep |

### Phase 17A: Subscription Infrastructure (T259–T264)

**Purpose**: Introduce subscription logic while keeping existing purchase store structure intact.

- [x] T259 Add `react-native-iap` dependency to packages/shared/package.json and apps/aws-clp/package.json. Configure native module linking for Android. Run `cd apps/aws-clp && npx pod-install` if needed. Verify build succeeds. **Note**: `react-native-iap` supports both subscriptions and one-time purchases — use `requestSubscription()` and `getSubscriptions()` APIs.

- [x] T260 Create packages/shared/src/services/billing.service.ts:
  ```ts
  // Core subscription billing service methods
  initBilling(): Promise<void>                              // Initialize IAP connection
  getSubscriptions(skus: string[]): Promise<Subscription[]> // Fetch subscription details from Play Store
  subscribe(sku: string): Promise<SubscriptionResult>       // Initiate subscription flow
  restorePurchases(): Promise<Purchase[]>                   // Restore active subscriptions
  validateSubscription(token: string): Promise<SubscriptionStatus>  // Server-side or local validation
  checkExpiry(): Promise<boolean>                           // Check if cached subscription has expired
  handleRenewal(purchase: Purchase): Promise<void>          // Process subscription renewal
  acknowledgePurchase(token: string): Promise<void>         // Acknowledge (required by Google)
  finishTransaction(purchase: Purchase): Promise<void>      // Complete transaction lifecycle
  cancelSubscription(): void                                // Open Play Store subscription management
  ```
  Handle connection lifecycle (connect on init, disconnect on unmount). Handle `__DEV__` bypass.

  **Subscription type constants**:
  ```ts
  export type SubscriptionPlan = 'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'annual';
  export const SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS: Record<SubscriptionPlan, { label: string; savings: string | null }> = {
    monthly:   { label: 'Monthly',   savings: null },
    quarterly: { label: 'Quarterly', savings: '22% off' },
    annual:    { label: 'Annual',    savings: '44% off' },
  };
  ```

- [x] T261 Implement subscription purchase flow in billing.service.ts:
  1. Connect to Play Store billing client
  2. Fetch subscription details (price, billing period) via `getSubscriptions([...skus])`
  3. Initiate subscription via `subscribe(sku)` — opens Play Store subscription dialog
  4. On success: acknowledge, update purchase store to PREMIUM with expiry data, persist to SQLite
  5. On cancel: return to UpgradeScreen, no side effects
  6. On error: show error message, allow retry
  7. On pending (PAYMENT_PENDING): show "Subscription pending" status, check again on next launch
  8. Store `expiryDate`, `autoRenewing`, and `subscriptionType` in PurchaseStatus

- [X] T262 Extend packages/shared/src/storage/repositories/purchase.repository.ts and database.ts:
  - **Non-breaking migration**: ADD columns to existing PurchaseStatus table (do not drop/recreate):
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE PurchaseStatus ADD COLUMN subscription_type TEXT;      -- 'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'annual' | null
    ALTER TABLE PurchaseStatus ADD COLUMN expiry_date TEXT;            -- ISO 8601 expiry timestamp
    ALTER TABLE PurchaseStatus ADD COLUMN auto_renewing INTEGER DEFAULT 0; -- boolean: 1 = auto-renewing
    ```
  - Update `PurchaseStatus` interface to include new fields:
    ```ts
    interface PurchaseStatus {
      id: string;
      tier_level: TierLevel;
      product_id: string | null;
      purchase_token: string | null;
      purchased_at: string | null;
      subscription_type: SubscriptionPlan | null;  // NEW
      expiry_date: string | null;                  // NEW
      auto_renewing: boolean;                      // NEW
      created_at: string;
      updated_at: string;
    }
    ```
  - Update `savePurchaseStatus()` to persist new fields
  - **No schema-breaking changes**: Existing rows with `null` subscription fields remain valid (backward-compatible with Phase 16 data)

- [X] T263 Update packages/shared/src/stores/purchase.store.ts: integrate with billing service for subscriptions.
  - Add state fields: `subscriptionType: SubscriptionPlan | null`, `expiryDate: string | null`, `autoRenewing: boolean`
  - Add action: `setSubscription(productId, purchaseToken, subscriptionType, expiryDate, autoRenewing)` — sets PREMIUM + subscription metadata, persists to SQLite
  - Keep existing `setPremium()` for backward compatibility (calls `setSubscription` internally)
  - Add action: `checkAndDowngrade()` — if `expiryDate` is past and `autoRenewing` is false → reset to FREE
  - On app launch: `loadFromStorage()` → if subscription data exists → call `checkAndDowngrade()` before granting PREMIUM
  - Add selectors: `useSubscriptionType()`, `useExpiryDate()`, `useIsAutoRenewing()`

- [X] T264 Implement subscription restoration and expiry handling in billing.service.ts:
  - On app reinstall or new device: call `restorePurchases()` during initialization (after login, before question sync)
  - If active subscription found → restore PREMIUM status with full subscription metadata
  - If expired subscription found → set FREE, show "Subscription expired" message
  - If not found → remain FREE
  - `checkExpiry()`: called on each app launch — compare `expiryDate` with current date:
    - If expired + `autoRenewing = false` → downgrade to FREE automatically
    - If expired + `autoRenewing = true` → attempt `restorePurchases()` to check renewal; if renewed → update expiry; if not → downgrade
  - `handleRenewal()`: when Play Store sends renewal event via purchase listener → update `expiryDate` and `purchaseToken` in store + SQLite

### Phase 17B: Subscription UI (T265–T266)

**Purpose**: Replace UpgradeScreen content with 3-plan subscription selector. Maintain existing CTA structure.

- [ ] T265 Update packages/shared/src/screens/UpgradeScreen.tsx:
  - **Replace** one-time "Forever Access" branding with subscription plan selector
  - Display 3 plan cards (Monthly $2.99, Quarterly $6.99, Annual $19.99):
    - Each card shows: plan name, price, effective monthly cost, savings badge
    - Quarterly card highlighted as **"MOST POPULAR"** (recommended default)
    - Annual card shows **"BEST VALUE"** badge
  - Pre-select Quarterly plan by default
  - Connect CTA button to `billing.service.subscribe(selectedSku)`
  - Show loading spinner during subscription flow
  - On success: show success message, navigate to HomeScreen
  - On error: show error message with retry button
  - Fetch and display localized prices from Play Store (don't hardcode prices)
  - Add "Restore Subscription" link at bottom for reinstall scenarios
  - If already PREMIUM: show subscription status (plan, renewal date, auto-renew toggle)
  - Add "Manage Subscription" link → opens Play Store subscription management
  - Keep existing free vs premium comparison table (update wording from "Forever Access" to "Premium Access")

- [ ] T266 Handle subscription edge cases in billing.service.ts and UpgradeScreen:
  - PAYMENT_PENDING: Store pending status, check on next launch, show "Subscription pending" badge
  - Cancelled subscription: Access continues until `expiryDate`, show "Expires on {date}" in settings
  - Expired subscription: Auto-downgrade to FREE, show "Subscription expired — renew to continue" prompt
  - Refunded subscription: If server-side validation (T262.5) enabled, check periodically; downgrade to FREE
  - Network error during subscription: Subscription saved by Play Store, acknowledged on next launch
  - Play Store unavailable: Show "Play Store required" message
  - Already subscribed: Show current plan details, allow plan changes via Play Store
  - Grace period: Google Play provides a grace period for failed payments — maintain PREMIUM during grace period
  - Account hold: After grace period, Google puts subscription on hold — downgrade to FREE, show "Update payment" prompt
  - Upgrade/downgrade between plans: Handled by Play Store UI (prorated). App re-reads subscription details on resume.

### Phase 17C: Multi-App & Deprecation (T267)

**Purpose**: Configure per-app subscription product IDs. Deprecate one-time purchase references.

- [ ] T267 Configure per-app subscription product IDs:
  - Product ID pattern per plan:
    - `monthly_{examTypeId.toLowerCase().replace('-', '_')}` (e.g., `monthly_clf_c02`, `monthly_saa_c03`)
    - `quarterly_{examTypeId.toLowerCase().replace('-', '_')}` (e.g., `quarterly_clf_c02`, `quarterly_saa_c03`)
    - `annual_{examTypeId.toLowerCase().replace('-', '_')}` (e.g., `annual_clf_c02`, `annual_saa_c03`)
  - Add `subscriptionSkus` to AppConfig interface in packages/shared/src/config/types.ts:
    ```ts
    interface AppConfig {
      examTypeId: string;
      appName: string;
      branding: { primaryColor: string };
      subscriptionSkus: {
        monthly: string;
        quarterly: string;
        annual: string;
      };
    }
    ```
  - Update each app's config:
    - `apps/aws-clp/src/config/app.config.ts` → `subscriptionSkus: { monthly: 'monthly_clf_c02', quarterly: 'quarterly_clf_c02', annual: 'annual_clf_c02' }`
    - `apps/saa-c03/src/config/app.config.ts` → `subscriptionSkus: { monthly: 'monthly_saa_c03', quarterly: 'quarterly_saa_c03', annual: 'annual_saa_c03' }`
  - Update apps/template/src/config/app.config.ts.template to include `__SUBSCRIPTION_SKUS__` placeholder tokens:
    ```ts
    subscriptionSkus: {
      monthly: 'monthly___EXAM_TYPE_SKU__',
      quarterly: 'quarterly___EXAM_TYPE_SKU__',
      annual: 'annual___EXAM_TYPE_SKU__',
    },
    ```
  - Update scripts/create-app.sh to auto-generate `__EXAM_TYPE_SKU__` from examTypeId (lowercase, replace `-` with `_`)
  - **Deprecation**: Remove `forever_access_*` references from all documentation. Remove hardcoded `$14.99` price from UpgradeScreen. Remove "Forever Access" branding text.

### Backend Validation (Optional — T262.5)

- [ ] T262.5 (Optional) Create api/src/billing/ module for server-side subscription validation:
  - `POST /api/billing/verify-subscription` endpoint
  - Accepts: `{ productId: string, purchaseToken: string, packageName: string }`
  - Validates subscription token with Google Play Developer API (`purchases.subscriptionsv2.get`)
  - Returns: `{ valid: boolean, expiryTimeMillis: number, autoRenewing: boolean, paymentState: number, cancelReason?: number }`
  - Provides additional security against local subscription spoofing
  - Can be called periodically (e.g., on app launch when online) to re-validate subscription status
  - Requires Google Play Developer API service account credentials (reuse Play Integrity service account)

### Testing & Documentation Tasks (T268–T270)

- [ ] T268 Create packages/shared/__tests__/billing.service.test.ts:
  - Mock react-native-iap module
  - Test subscription flow: subscribe success, cancel, error, pending for each plan (monthly, quarterly, annual)
  - Test subscription restoration: active found, expired found, not found
  - Test expiry checking: active subscription, expired + auto-renewing, expired + cancelled
  - Test renewal handling: update expiry date and token
  - Test automatic downgrade: expired subscription → FREE tier
  - Test acknowledgement lifecycle
  - Test `__DEV__` bypass (defaults to PREMIUM)
  - Test per-app subscription SKU generation from examTypeId
  - Test grace period and account hold states

- [ ] T269 Create documentation: specs/003-play-integrity/subscription-setup-guide.md:
  - Play Console setup: create 3 subscription products per app, set base plans and pricing
  - Subscription product ID naming convention per exam type and plan
  - Pricing table: Monthly $2.99, Quarterly $6.99, Annual $19.99
  - Testing with license testers (set up in Play Console — subscriptions auto-renew faster in test mode)
  - Testing with Google Play internal test track
  - Server-side validation setup (if T262.5 implemented)
  - Subscription lifecycle: active → grace period → account hold → cancelled → expired
  - Troubleshooting common subscription billing errors
  - Play Console subscription reporting and analytics

- [ ] T270 End-to-end subscription validation:
  1. Upload app to Play Console internal test track
  2. Create 3 subscription products (monthly, quarterly, annual) per exam app
  3. Add license testers
  4. Install test build on device
  5. Complete subscription flow: UpgradeScreen → select Quarterly plan → Play Store → subscribe → unlock
  6. Verify questions accessible (full bank unlocked)
  7. Wait for test subscription to expire (accelerated in test mode) → verify auto-downgrade to FREE
  8. Resubscribe → verify PREMIUM restored
  9. Uninstall → reinstall → "Restore Subscription" → verify active subscription restored
  10. Test with second exam app (different subscription SKUs)
  11. Test plan switching (monthly → annual) via Play Store subscription management
  12. Document: subscription completes in <10s, restore completes in <5s, expiry check <100ms

**Checkpoint**: Subscription model works end-to-end. Free users see 15 questions. Subscribed users see all. Active subscription = PREMIUM. Expired subscription = auto-downgrade to FREE. Each app has unique subscription SKUs (3 per app).

## Notes for Implementers (Phase 5)

1. **Phase 16 ships independently**: Free tier works without Play Billing access. Ship it to validate login gate and conversion flow.
2. **UpgradeScreen already exists**: Don't recreate it. Enhance the existing UI at `packages/shared/src/screens/UpgradeScreen.tsx`.
3. **Consistent free question set**: FREE tier users must always see the same 15 questions (ordered by domain + id). This prevents gaming by reinstalling.
4. **Login is already implemented**: Google OAuth via `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` is fully working. Just enforce it as a gate in AppRoot.
5. **`__DEV__` bypass for billing**: In dev mode, default to PREMIUM tier. Don't require billing setup for local development.
6. **react-native-iap is mature**: 10K+ GitHub stars, supports Play Billing Library v6+ subscriptions. Use `getSubscriptions()` and `requestSubscription()` APIs.
7. **Per-app subscription SKUs prevent conflicts**: `monthly_clf_c02` and `monthly_saa_c03` are separate products. No cross-app entitlement. 3 SKUs per app (monthly, quarterly, annual).
8. **Server-side validation (T262.5) is optional but recommended**: Prevents local subscription spoofing and provides accurate expiry data. Adds ~1 hour of work.
9. **No Prisma schema changes**: Subscription status is mobile-local only (SQLite). Backend subscription verification (T262.5) is stateless.
10. **Price localization**: Use Play Billing API to fetch localized prices. Don't hardcode $2.99/$6.99/$19.99 — prices vary by country.
11. **Subscription expiry handling**: Check `expiryDate` on every app launch. If expired + not auto-renewing → downgrade to FREE immediately. If expired + auto-renewing → try `restorePurchases()` to detect renewal.
12. **TierLevel stays FREE | PREMIUM**: Do not introduce new tier levels. Active subscription = PREMIUM. Expired/cancelled = FREE. The `subscriptionType` field tracks *which* plan, not *which* tier.
13. **PurchaseStatus table is extended, not replaced**: New columns (`subscription_type`, `expiry_date`, `auto_renewing`) are added via ALTER TABLE. Existing rows with null values remain valid. No migration breakage.
14. **Quarterly is the default recommended plan**: Pre-select it in the UI. Most exam prep takes 2-3 months — this aligns with user behavior and maximizes revenue per user.
