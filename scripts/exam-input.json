      "explanation": "AWS offers multiple cloud-based storage options that you can use for your infrastructure. Each has a unique combination of performance, durability, availability, cost, and interface, as well as other characteristics such as scalability and elasticity. These additional characteristics are critical for web-scale cloud-based solutions. As with traditional on-premises applications, you can use multiple cloud storage options together to form a comprehensive data storage hierarchy.\n\nAmazon S3 is optimal for storing numerous classes of information that are relatively static and benefit from its durability, availability, and elasticity features. However, in a number of situations, Amazon S3 is not the optimal solution.\n\nRapidly changing data \u2013 Data that must be updated very frequently might be better served by a storage solution with lower read / write latencies, such as Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon RDS or other relational databases, or Amazon DynamoDB.\n\nHence, the correct answers are Amazon EBS and Amazon RDS just as mentioned above. These services are suitable to use in storing rapidly changing data with low read and write latencies.\n\nAWS Snowball is incorrect because this is a petabyte-scale data migration solution that uses hardware devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS Cloud.\n\nAmazon S3 is incorrect because this service is optimal for storing numerous classes of information that are relatively static and not rapidly changing data just as what was mentioned in this scenario.\n\nAmazon AppStream 2.0 is incorrect because this is a fully managed application streaming service which you can use to centrally manage your desktop applications."

You can also use Software Development Kits (SDKs) to interact with your AWS services. SDKs take the complexity out of coding by providing language-specific APIs for AWS services.\n\nHence, the correct answers are: AWS Command Line Interface and AWS SDKs.\n\nElastic Network Interface is incorrect because this is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.\n\nAWS Artifact is incorrect because this service provides on-demand access to AWS' security and compliance reports.\n\nAWS Organizations is incorrect because this is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization."

CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.\n\nHence, the correct answer is: AWS CloudTrail.\n\nAmazon CloudWatch is incorrect because this service is primarily used to collect monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.\n\nAWS Config is incorrect because this is just a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.\n\nAWS Infrastructure Event Management is incorrect because this is a structured program available to Enterprise Support customers that helps you plan for large-scale events."
